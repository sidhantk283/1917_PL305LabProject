Pixxel is a stock image website where you can get stock images for your website
or graphic design or might be any project you working on. Stock images is
existing photos –already created– made available download by paying the artist
or free for personal use. Images can be stock photographs, graphic designs,
vector art or illustrations. So basically In pixxel we can download stock images
for free but the user has to acknowledge the creator’s right over the image
by giving credit to the creator. Also you can buy the image by giving a tip
to the creator using our pixxel wallet.
Creator can create his own collections to showcase his art and create a brand
for himself.
